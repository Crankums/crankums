### Hi there 👋

My name is Craig. I'm a recent graduate of Flatiron School's software engineering program, specializing in fullstack web development in Rails and JavaScript. I currently work for the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust as a Full-Stack Ruby on Rails Developer.

My personal stack includes Ruby💎, Ruby on Rails🚆, JavaScript, React⚛, Redux, Sagas, NodeJs, PostgreSQL🐘, MongoDB🍃 and more.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ...
  - A Rails/React punch clock app using GraphQL and making more use of pure components. I've affectionately named it Clocko
  - A series of small tools in vanilla JS and plain ol' Ruby to use to help train new employees at work.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
  - Python🐍, with a focus towards web development. This language really speaks to my roots in Ruby
  - Always looking up another JS framework, including MoonJS, SailsJS, and MeteorJS
  - GraphQL🕸 is very interesting and I'm learning how to plug it into more languages/frameworks that I'm already familiar with
